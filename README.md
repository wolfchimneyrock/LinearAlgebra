## Linear Algebra
These are the homework assignments completed in LaTeX for my linear algebra course MATH2101 Summer 2016.  Each set consists of five major questions with numerous sub-questions.  Some of the sets are more theoretical, and some are more applied.  In most cases question 5 is a set of review exercises.
